# This Repo contains various rather small JS-Projects

In order to learn and understand different approaches in Javascript this repository summarizes some cool projects.

## Custom Video Player

Can be found under directory "video-player" and shows the quick and easy use of the Video/Audio-API from:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Video_and_audio_APIs


## Exchange Rate Calculator

Just practising some DOM-Manipulation together with the fetch-API.

For later notice: Remove fetch api and use async together with promises.

## Expense Tracker

Small expense tracker to plan some vacation or to track monthly expenses. Uses localStorage for "persistant" data storage.


## Rock Paper Scissors

Just some small Rock, Paper, Scissors Game against the computer!
